# NightShift Quickstart

This guide runs NightShift with safe example files, including an end-to-end patch workflow.

## 1. Install for Development

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or run the module directly:

```bash
python -m nightshift.cli --help
```

## 2. Create Starter Files

From a project directory:

```bash
nightshift init
```

This creates:

```text
nightshift.yaml
tasks.md
agents/
```

Existing starter files are not overwritten unless you pass `--force`.

## 3. Validate

```bash
nightshift validate
```

Validation checks config structure, task parsing, prompt files, scoped paths, and command safety.

## 4. Run One Task

Run the next incomplete task:

```bash
nightshift run
```

Run a specific task:

```bash
nightshift run --task TASK-001
```

## 5. Review Artifacts

After a run, inspect:

```text
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/
```

Useful files:

```text
run-summary.md
config.snapshot.yaml
project-context-chart.md
tasks/TASK-001/task.md
tasks/TASK-001/context.md
tasks/TASK-001/plan.md
tasks/TASK-001/context-pack.md
tasks/TASK-001/proposed.patch
tasks/TASK-001/normalized.patch
tasks/TASK-001/patch-validation.md
tasks/TASK-001/applied.patch
tasks/TASK-001/patch-apply-output.txt
tasks/TASK-001/test-output.txt
tasks/TASK-001/stage-results.md
tasks/TASK-001/context-out.md
tasks/TASK-001/final-notes.md
```

## Example Templates

Example run files are available in `templates/`.
They are safe starter examples and use command-backed fake agents.

The repository also includes a complete sample target project:

```text
examples/quickstart-lisp/
```

Copy that directory elsewhere if you want to test NightShift against a multi-task project that modifies real code through patch mode.

## Quickstart Test Project

A good first real target project is a tiny Lisp interpreter in Python. It is small enough to review, but it naturally breaks into multiple tasks that test NightShift's planning, implementation, command execution, artifacts, reports, and dependency handling.

If you do not want a language interpreter, use a small config parser or markdown todo CLI instead. The Lisp interpreter is the recommended default because it has clear incremental milestones and simple tests.

### 1. Create a Target Project

```bash
mkdir tiny-lisp
cd tiny-lisp
mkdir agents tests
touch lisp.py tests/test_lisp.py
```

### 2. Add `nightshift.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: tiny-lisp
  root: .
  task_file: tasks.md
  artifact_dir: .nightshift

safety:
  require_clean_worktree: false
  scoped_paths:
    - .
  allowed_commands:
    - python -m unittest discover -v
  forbidden_commands:
    - rm -rf
    - git push
    - curl | bash

agents:
  planner:
    backend: command
    command: python agents/fake_planner.py
    system_prompt: agents/planner.md

  implementer:
    backend: command
    command: python agents/fake_code_writer.py
    system_prompt: agents/implementer.md

  reviewer:
    backend: command
    command: python -c "print('status: pass'); print('reason: quickstart reviewer accepted artifacts')"
    system_prompt: agents/reviewer.md

pipeline:
  max_task_retries: 1
  continue_on_task_failure: false
  stages:
    - id: plan
      type: agent
      agent: planner
      output: plan.md

    - id: context
      type: repo_context
      output: context-pack.md

    - id: implement
      type: code_writer
      agent: implementer
      output: proposed.patch

    - id: normalize
      type: patch_normalizer
      output: normalized.patch

    - id: validate_patch
      type: patch_validator
      output: patch-validation.md
      on_fail: implement

    - id: apply_patch
      type: patch_apply
      mode: apply
      output: patch-apply-output.txt
      on_fail: implement

    - id: test
      type: command
      commands:
        - python -m unittest discover -v
      output: test-output.txt
      on_fail: implement

    - id: review
      type: agent_review
      agent: reviewer
      on_fail: implement
      output: review.md

    - id: summarize
      type: summarize
      output: final-notes.md
```

This uses fake command-backed planner and code-writer fixtures so the pipeline is deterministic but still inspects files and modifies real files through patch mode. Replace the fake agent commands later with your real local agent wrapper.

### 3. Add `tasks.md`

```markdown
# Tasks

- [ ] TASK-001: Parse Lisp expressions

Implement tokenization and parsing for a tiny Lisp subset.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Parses numbers
- Parses symbols
- Parses nested lists
- Raises useful errors for unbalanced parentheses
- Includes unit tests

- [ ] TASK-002: Evaluate arithmetic forms

Dependencies:
- TASK-001

- Evaluates nested arithmetic
- Includes unit tests

- [ ] TASK-003: Add variables and definitions

Dependencies:
- TASK-002

Description:
Add an environment and support variable lookup and definitions.

Dependencies:
- TASK-003

Description:
Implement simple truthiness and `if` expressions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Supports `(if condition then else)`
- Handles false-like values consistently
- Includes tests for both branches
```

### 4. Add Prompt Files and Fake Agent Fixtures

`agents/planner.md`:

```markdown
You are the planning agent. Create a small, conservative plan for the task.
Do not write code. Include files to edit, tests to add, and risks.
```

`agents/implementer.md`:

```markdown
You are the implementation agent. Output only a unified diff.
Preserve existing behavior and include tests when needed.
```

The config above also expects two deterministic Python fixtures:

```text
agents/fake_planner.py
agents/fake_code_writer.py
```

If you have the NightShift checkout locally, copy the working fixtures from the included example project.

PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item C:\Users\metis\Documents\GitHub\nightShift\examples\quickstart-lisp\agents\fake_planner.py agents\
Copy-Item C:\Users\metis\Documents\GitHub\nightShift\examples\quickstart-lisp\agents\fake_code_writer.py agents\
```

Bash:

```bash
cp /path/to/nightShift/examples/quickstart-lisp/agents/fake_planner.py agents/
cp /path/to/nightShift/examples/quickstart-lisp/agents/fake_code_writer.py agents/
```

These fixtures make the manual project behave like `examples/quickstart-lisp/`: the fake planner requests repository context, and the fake code writer emits a real unified diff.

`agents/reviewer.md`:

```markdown
You are the review agent. Decide whether the task should pass, retry, or fail.

Output:
status: pass | fail | retry | escalate
reason: <short explanation>
next_stage: <optional stage id>
context_update: <compact useful note>
```

### 5. Add an Initial Passing Test File

```python
# tests/test_lisp.py
import unittest


class SmokeTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_smoke(self):
        self.assertTrue(True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### 6. Validate and Run

```bash
nightshift validate
nightshift status
nightshift run --task TASK-001
```

Run all currently runnable tasks:

```bash
nightshift run --all
```

The included `examples/quickstart-lisp/` fake code writer implements the first parser task by emitting a patch. It exercises lookup, context-pack generation, patch normalization, validation, application, tests, reports, and artifacts before you connect a real model-backed agent.

Use `mode: dry_run` on the `patch_apply` stage when you want to verify that a patch would apply without changing files. Use `mode: apply` when the validated patch should be written to the target project.

### 7. Review Artifacts

After a run, inspect:

```text
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/run-summary.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/plan.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/files-inspected.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/context-pack.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/proposed.patch
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/normalized.patch
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/patch-validation.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/applied.patch
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/patch-apply-output.txt
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/test-output.txt
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/review.md
.nightshift/runs/<run-id>/tasks/TASK-001/final-notes.md
```

The useful signal is whether NightShift selected the right task, respected dependencies, generated context, validated and applied a patch, ran tests, wrote artifacts, updated task completion, and produced a clear summary.
