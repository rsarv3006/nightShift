# NightShift

## Auditable Local-First AI Coding Pipelines

Version: v0.1 Draft
Author: K455
Status: Design Proposal

---

# 1. Executive Summary

NightShift is a local-first AI pipeline runner designed to execute long-running coding workflows against a constrained project workspace.

The system is intended to run overnight or unattended for extended periods while remaining:

* Cheap
* Correct
* Auditable
* Safe
* Reviewable

NightShift is not designed to be a fully autonomous "AI software engineer."
Instead, it is a deterministic orchestration system that allows fallible AI agents to operate within constrained, test-driven, auditable workflows.

The core philosophy is:

> Treat LLMs like unreliable distributed systems.

Agents are bounded by:

* Scoped repository access
* Structured stage contracts
* Explicit retry behavior
* Tests and static checks
* Review stages
* Context compaction
* Artifact logging

The intended workflow is:

1. User provides:

   * Repository
   * Task list
   * Pipeline configuration
   * Agent definitions

2. NightShift:

   * Selects the next task
   * Generates a plan
   * Reviews the plan
   * Implements changes
   * Runs tests/static analysis
   * Reviews results
   * Retries if necessary
   * Produces an overnight report

The result is a reviewable repository state and a full audit trail of AI behavior.

# 2. Goals

## 2.1 Primary Goals

### Local-first execution

The system should work primarily with local models and local execution environments.

Examples:

* Ollama
* Local transformers
* Local agent runtimes
* Claude Code
* Codex CLI

### Long-running unattended workflows

NightShift should support:

* Overnight execution
* Large task chains
* Multi-stage workflows
* Automated retries
* Context handoff between stages

### Auditability

Every important action should be recorded.

Users should be able to inspect:

* Prompts
* Plans
* Reviews
* Command outputs
* Diffs
* Test results
* Retry reasoning
* Final summaries

### Cheapness-first execution

The orchestration layer should assume:

* Cheap local models handle most work
* Expensive models are escalation layers
* Context size matters
* Token usage matters
* Retry cost matters

### Safe repository boundaries

The system should:

* Restrict file access
* Restrict shell commands
* Avoid destructive operations
* Minimize repository damage

---

## 2.2 Non-Goals (v1)

The following are intentionally out of scope for v1:

* Fully autonomous software development
* Parallel distributed execution
* Automatic deployment
* Cloud-native orchestration
* Dynamic self-modifying pipelines
* Autonomous internet access
* Agent swarms
* Arbitrary Python execution hooks
* Automatic git pushes
* Full DAG orchestration

---

# 3. Design Philosophy

NightShift is built around several core principles.

## 3.1 Deterministic orchestration

Agents are nondeterministic.

The orchestration system should not be.

Pipeline behavior should be:

* Predictable
* Reproducible
* Configurable
* Explicit

---

## 3.2 Structured state transitions

NightShift uses a state-machine workflow model.

A task moves through defined stages:

```text
Task Queue
  -> Plan
  -> Plan Review
  -> Implement
  -> Test
  -> Static Check
  -> Review
  -> Retry / Complete
```

Each stage produces:

```yaml
status: pass | fail | retry | escalate
reason: string
next_stage: optional
context_update: optional
```

This allows the pipeline runner to remain deterministic even while agents are probabilistic.

---

## 3.3 Context compaction

Agents should not inherit unlimited history.

Instead:

* Project-level context is persistent and compact
* Task-level context is scoped
* Retry context is summarized
* Stage context is minimized

This reduces:

* Token costs
* Context poisoning
* Hallucination drift
* Recursive confusion

---

## 3.4 Reviewability over autonomy

NightShift is optimized to produce:

* Reviewable code
* Reviewable reports
* Reviewable reasoning

The primary output is:

> A useful morning review state.

Not:

> Fully autonomous shipping.

# 5. Workflow Model

## 5.1 State Machine Model

NightShift uses a configurable state-machine workflow.

This was selected over:

* DAG orchestration
* Arbitrary scripting

because:

* v1 executes one task at a time
* Retry loops are first-class
* Auditability is easier
* Deterministic transitions are simpler

---

## 5.2 Default Pipeline

```text
PLAN
  ↓
REVIEW_PLAN
  ↓
IMPLEMENT
  ↓
TEST
  ↓
STATIC_ANALYSIS
  ↓
REVIEW
  ↓
DECISION
```

Decision outcomes:

* COMPLETE
* RETRY_IMPLEMENTATION
* RETRY_PLANNING
* FAIL

---

## 5.3 Configurable Pipelines

Pipelines are defined declaratively.

Users may:

* Swap stage orders
* Add/remove stages
* Define retry behavior
* Use different models
* A/B test prompts
* Experiment with reasoning structures

---

# 6. Configuration System

## 6.1 Configuration Format

NightShift uses YAML configuration files.

Reasons:

* Human-readable
* Good nested structure support
* Easier workflow representation than TOML
* Safer than arbitrary Python execution

---

## 6.2 Example Configuration

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  root: .
  task_file: tasks.md
  artifact_dir: .nightshift

safety:
  require_clean_worktree: true

  scoped_paths:
    - src/
    - tests/

  forbidden_commands:
    - rm -rf
    - git push

  allowed_commands:
    - cargo test
    - cargo fmt
    - cargo clippy

agents:
  planner:
    backend: ollama
    model: qwen2.5-coder:14b
    system_prompt: agents/planner.md

  implementer:
    backend: claude-code
    model: sonnet
    system_prompt: agents/implementer.md

  reviewer:
    backend: ollama
    model: deepseek-r1:32b
    system_prompt: agents/reviewer.md

  max_task_retries: 3

  stages:
    - id: plan
      type: agent
      agent: planner

    - id: review_plan
      type: review
      agent: reviewer
      on_fail: plan

    - id: implement
      type: agent
      agent: implementer

    - id: test
      type: command
      commands:
        - cargo test

    - id: static
      type: command
      commands:
        - cargo fmt --check
        - cargo clippy -- -D warnings

    - id: review
      type: review
      agent: reviewer
      on_fail: implement
```

---

# 7. Task System

## 7.1 Task Format

Tasks are defined in markdown.

Example:

```markdown
- [ ] TASK-001: Add retry support to pipeline runner

Acceptance Criteria:
- Retries configurable per stage
- Retry summaries persisted
- Retry count visible in final report
```

---

## 7.2 Task Lifecycle

Each task:

1. Is parsed
2. Is assigned a workspace
3. Receives planning
4. Receives implementation
5. Is validated
6. Is reviewed
7. Produces artifacts
8. Is marked complete or failed

---

## 7.3 Task Dependencies

Future versions may support:

```text
TASK-003 depends on TASK-001
```

However:

* Tasks should remain independently testable when possible
* Pipelines should maintain a buildable repository state

---

# 8. Agent Model

## 8.1 Agent Roles

Agents are specialized.

Example roles:

* planner
* implementer
* reviewer
* summarizer
* test-writer

---

## 8.2 Agent Definitions

Agents are configurable.

Each agent defines:

* Backend
* Model
* System prompt
* Constraints
* Output schema

---

## 8.3 Multi-Backend Support

NightShift should support:

* Ollama
* Claude Code
* Codex CLI
* Future local runners

This allows:

* Cheap local planning
* Expensive selective escalation
* Hybrid pipelines

---

## 8.4 Structured Outputs

Agents should emit machine-readable results.

Example:

```yaml
status: pass
summary: |
  Tests succeeded.
issues:
  - None
next_stage: review
```

---

# 9. Context System

## 9.1 Context Layers

NightShift uses layered context.

### Project Context

Long-lived information:

* Architecture
* Coding standards
* Constraints
* Previous summaries

---

### Task Context

Task-specific information:

* Acceptance criteria
* Relevant files
* Prior retries
* Implementation notes

---

### Retry Context

Compact summaries of:

* Previous failures
* Previous reviews
* Previous test errors

---

## 9.2 Context Compaction

Every stage should summarize output.

This prevents:

* Infinite context growth
* Token explosion
* Recursive hallucination
* Low-signal history accumulation

---

# 10. Safety Model

## 10.1 Repository Scope Restrictions

NightShift should restrict:

* Accessible directories
* Writable paths
* Executable commands

---

## 10.2 Command Restrictions

Commands are allowlisted.

Potentially dangerous commands are forbidden.

Examples:

```text
Forbidden:
- rm -rf
- git push
- curl | bash
```

---

## 10.3 Clean Worktree Requirement

v1 may optionally require:

```text
git status == clean
```

before execution.

This simplifies:

* Auditability
* Recovery
* Diff inspection

---

# 11. Testing and Validation

## 11.1 Validation Pipeline

Validation occurs in multiple stages:

```text
Tests
  ↓
Static Analysis
  ↓
Review Agent
  ↓
Decision
```

---

## 11.2 Global Test Suite

Tests are global.

Rationale:

* New changes must not break old functionality
* Pipeline should maintain cumulative stability

---

## 11.3 Generated Tests

Agents may generate tests for features.

Generated tests become part of the persistent suite.

---

# 12. Artifact System

## 12.1 Artifact Goals

Artifacts provide:

* Auditability
* Replayability
* Debugging
* Historical inspection
* Prompt experimentation

---

## 12.2 Example Layout

```text
.nightshift/
  project-context.md

  runs/
    2026-05-16-overnight/
      run-summary.md
      config.snapshot.yaml

      tasks/
        TASK-001/
          task.md
          plan.md
          plan-review.md
          implementation-log.md
          test-output.txt
          static-output.txt
          review.md
          final-notes.md
          diff.patch
          context-out.md
```

---

# 13. Overnight Report

At completion NightShift generates:

* Completed tasks
* Failed tasks
* Retry counts
* Files modified
* Test results
* Reviewer summaries
* Remaining issues
* Suggested follow-up work

The goal is:

> Wake up to a review package.

---

# 14. Future Directions

Potential future features:

* Parallel task execution
* DAG workflows
* Distributed workers
* Sandboxed containers
* Git branch isolation
* Agent tournaments
* Constraint language experimentation
* Prompt A/B testing
* Semantic memory systems

---

# 15. Risks

## 15.1 Context poisoning

Mitigation:

* Context compaction
* Retry summarization
* Structured stage boundaries

---

## 15.2 Agent loops

Mitigation:

* Explicit retry counts
* Deterministic transitions
* Timeout handling

---

## 15.3 Repository damage

Mitigation:

* Validation stages

---

## 15.4 Cost explosion

Mitigation:

1. Parse markdown tasks
2. Execute a declarative pipeline
3. Support local agents
4. Generate plans
5. Generate implementations
6. Run tests
7. Run static analysis
8. Run review agents
9. Retry failed stages
10. Produce artifacts
11. Produce an overnight summary
12. Restrict repository access

This MVP is sufficient to:

* Demonstrate orchestration architecture

Acceptance Criteria:

* User can monitor a run from a browser without controlling execution
* Dashboard works from existing artifact files
* Missing or partial run artifacts do not crash the server
* No config, task, command, or pipeline mutation is exposed from the UI

Notes:

* This phase should avoid websockets and process control at first.
* The dashboard should be artifact-driven so it remains decoupled from pipeline internals.
* Start/stop controls, authentication, live log streaming, and approval gates are separate future work.

# Closing Statement

NightShift is intended to explore a practical middle ground between:

* Fully manual software engineering
* Reckless autonomous agent systems

The system assumes that AI agents are useful but unreliable.

NightShift therefore treats agents as bounded workers inside deterministic, auditable, test-driven workflows.

The primary output is not blind autonomy.

The primary output is trustworthy leverage.
